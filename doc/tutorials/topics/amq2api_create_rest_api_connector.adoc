= Create a REST API connector

{prodname} can create connectors for REST APIs
that support Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.
To do this, {prodname} requires a valid
Swagger 2.0 specification that describes a REST API you want to connect to.

Your {prodname} installation provides the To Do app, which has a REST API
for accessing a database that contains tasks. Your installation also provides
a Swagger specification for this API.

To create a REST API connector for the To Do app:

. Identify the URL for your {prodname} installation's copy of the
Swagger specification:
.. In the {prodname} navigation panel, click *Home*.
.. Copy the URL into a text editor.
.. At the beginning of the URL, insert `*todo-*`.
.. At the end of the URL, replace `dashboard` with `*swagger.json*`.

+
The result is something like this:
`\https://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/swagger.json`

. In the {prodname} navigation panel, click *Customizations*.
. Click *Create API Connector*.
. Select *Use a URL*.
. In the input box, paste the URL for your Swagger specification and
click *Next*.
. On the *Review Swagger Actions* page, click *Next*. If you see
a warning, you can ignore it.
. Click *Next* again to accept *HTTP Basic Authorization*.
. On the *Review/Edit Connector Details* page, {prodname} populates
the fields with values from the Swagger specification. 
.. If you want to, you can 
change the values in the *Connector Name* and *Description* fields. 
.. Confirm that the value in the *Host* field is correct. For example, 
it should be something like this:
`\https://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com`.
.. Confirm that the value in the *Base URL* field is `/api`. 
. Click *Create Connector*.

{prodname} displays the *API Client Connectors* tab with an entry for
the *Todo App API* that you just created.
