= Confirm that the Salesforce to database integration works

To confirm that the Salesforce to database integration is working:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. If necessary, wait until your sample integration is a *Published* integration,
which means that it is running. If you used the example name, you would 
see that 
*Salesforce to Database Sample Integration* is *Published*.

. In your Salesforce installation, create a new lead. Be
sure to enter data
in the fields that you mapped: *Company*, *Email*, *FirstName*,
*LastName*, *LeadSource*, *Status*, *Phone*, and *Rating*.
. In a new browser window, insert `*todo-*` in front of the URL
for your {prodname} installation. For example: 
`\https://todo-app-proj7614.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/`.
+
Your {prodname} installation provides the To Do app, which has a 
REST API for accessing a database that contains tasks. In the AMQ to REST 
API sample integration tutorial, there are instructions for uploading a 
Swagger file for the To Do app to create an API client connector. 

. In the *To Do App* display, you should see a notification that a new 
lead was created in the database.
